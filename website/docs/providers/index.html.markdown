# Provider Documentation

Every Terraform provider has its own documentation, describing its resource
types and their arguments.

The [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers) is the
main home for provider documentation. When viewing a provider's page on the
Terraform Registry, you can click the "Documentation" link in the header to
browse its documentation.

Provider documentation in the Registry is versioned; you can use the version
menu in the header to change which version you're viewing.

Learn more about writing, generating, and rendering provider documentation
in the [provider publishing documentation](/docs/registry/providers/docs.html).

## Temporary Provider Documentation
